# line-masks
Routines to create formatted atomic line masks from an original VALD line list file (http://vald.astro.uu.se/).

You can find some example line masks extracted from VALD in the folder 'atomic_masks'. 
We rename the orginal file from VALD to something in the format: t4000_g4.0_m0.0_vmic1_total, where 't4000' corresponds to an effective temperature of 4000 K, 'g4.0' corresponds to a log g (cm/s^2) = 4.0, 'm0.0' corresponds to a metalicity M/H = 0.0, and 'vmic1' stands for a microturbulent velocity of 1 km/s.
